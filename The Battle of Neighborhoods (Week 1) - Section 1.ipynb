    "# Strategic Location for Purchasing a Residential Property for Short-term Rent Out (Airbnb) \n",
    "## Background / Business Problem\n",
    "Airbnbs are becoming more popular. They offer cheap short-term stay while providing the convinience of a complete property. However, they need to compete with the hotels in their vicinity. Hotels often host a restaurant which could be an important factor for those who care about having their meals close to their temporary location. Hence, for an Airbnb to be attractive enough for these kind of tourists, the number of restaurants in the neighborhood is of high importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem: \n",
    "A client is looking for the best neighbourhood to purchase a residential property to rent out as an Airbnb. Where could they purchase a rather cheap property which could attract a reasonable amount of tenants. Our reasoning would be based on number of hotels in the neighbourhood (which indicates level of competition), number of restaurants in the area (as an highly influential factor when choosing an Airbnb), and price of the residential properties in the area (as a decision factor for the client). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, the influence of other Airbnbs in the area is neglected. Furthermore, other factors to choose an Airbnb such as number of point-of-interests, museums, etc. are not included in this research. We also neglect the effect of costly restaurants and treat all restaurants as equally influential on the choise of Airbnb location. "
